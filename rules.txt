1. ARR32-C. Ensure size arguments for variable length arrays are in a valid range
We do this by checking that the input for board width and height are within a reasonable range.

2. EXP53-CPP :
We don't use uninitialized variables anywhere in our code.

3. ARR30-C:
We do not use out of bounds array indices anywhere in our code. We always check in prior if statements.
